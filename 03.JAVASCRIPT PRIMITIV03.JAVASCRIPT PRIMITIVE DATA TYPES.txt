Question 4: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.

Answer: In JavaScript, there are five primitive data types, which are basic and immutable. Here is a list and description of each:

	1. NUMBER
	The Number type in JavaScript is used to represent both integer and floating-point numbers.

	- Examples:
	  
	  let age = 30;            // Integer
	  let temperature = 98.6;  // Floating-point
	  let negative = -15;      // Negative number
	  let notANumber = NaN;    // Not-a-Number
  

	- Characteristics:
	  - JavaScript uses a double-precision 64-bit floating-point format.
	  - Special values include Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN (Not-a-Number).

	2. STRING
	The String type represents a sequence of characters used to store and manipulate text.

	- Examples:
	  
	  let greeting = "Hello, World!";
	  let singleChar = 'A';
	  let multiline = This is
	  a multiline
	  string.;
  

	- Characteristics:
	  - Strings can be defined using single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (  ).
	  - Backticks allow for template literals, enabling embedded expressions and multi-line strings.

	3. BOOLEAN
	The Boolean type represents a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.

	- Examples:
	 
	  let isCompleted = true;
	  let isOverdue = false;
  

	- Characteristics:
	  - Booleans are commonly used in conditional statements and control flow.

	4. UNDEFINED
	A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value has the type undefined.

	- Examples:
	  
	  let x;
	  console.log(x); // undefined
  

	- Characteristics:
	  - Indicates that a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value.

	5. NULL
	The null type represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable should have no value.

	- Examples:

	  let user = null;
  

	- Characteristics:
	  - null is an assignment value that can be used to represent the absence of a value.
	  - typeof null returns object, which is a quirk in JavaScript (but null is not actually an object).

	SUMMARY:
	These primitive data types form the basic building blocks for data manipulation in JavaScript. Understanding and using them correctly is crucial for effective 	programming in JavaScript.
	
	- Number: Represents numeric values.
	- String: Represents sequences of characters.
	- Boolean: Represents logical true/false values.
	- Undefined: Indicates a variable has not been assigned a value.
	- Null: Represents an intentional absence of value.
