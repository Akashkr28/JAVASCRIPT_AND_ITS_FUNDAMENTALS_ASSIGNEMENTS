Question 1: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.

Answer :- JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used in web development. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide 	Web, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. Hereâ€™s an overview of its role and 	importance in web development:

	KEY FEATURES OF JAVASCRIPT
	1. Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript runs in the browser, allowing developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages without the need for server-side 		processing.
	2. Interactivity: JavaScript is used to handle events like clicks, form submissions, and mouse movements, making websites responsive and engaging for users.
	3. DOM Manipulation: JavaScript can access and modify the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure of a web page. This allows developers to 		dynamically change the content, structure, and style of web pages.
	4. Asynchronous Programming: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming through callbacks, promises, and async/await. This is crucial for tasks like fetching 		data from a server without blocking the main thread.
	5. Rich Ecosystem: JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) that simplify and enhance web development.

	ROLE OF JAVASCRIPT IN WEB DEVELOPMENT
	1. Enhancing User Experience: JavaScript improves user experience by enabling features like form validation, interactive maps, animations, and real-time 		content updates.
	2. Building Single Page Applications (SPAs): With frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, developers can create SPAs where the entire application loads 		once and subsequent interactions are handled dynamically, leading to a smoother and faster user experience.
	3. Server-Side Development: With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side programming, allowing for full-stack development using a 		single language.
	4. Web APIs Integration: JavaScript can interact with various web APIs, enabling functionalities like geolocation, local storage, and network requests 			(AJAX/fetch).
	5. Cross-Platform Development: JavaScript can be used to develop cross-platform applications through technologies like Electron (for desktop apps) and React 		Native (for mobile apps).

	EXAMPLE USE CASES:

	1. Form Validation: Ensuring that user inputs meet certain criteria before submitting a form.
	   
	   document.getElementById('myForm').onsubmit = function() {
	       var name = document.getElementById('name').value;
 	      if (name == "") {
 	          alert("Name must be filled out");
 	          return false;
 	      }
 	      return true;
 	  };
   
	2. Dynamic Content Update: Changing content on the web page without reloading.
	   
	   document.getElementById('updateButton').onclick = function() {
	       document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = "New Content";
	   };
   
	3. AJAX Request: Fetching data from a server without reloading the page.

	   fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
	       .then(response => response.json())
	       .then(data => {
	           console.log(data);
	       })
	       .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
   

	CONCLUSION:
	JavaScript is a versatile and powerful language that plays a critical role in modern web development. Its ability to create dynamic, interactive, and 	responsive web pages makes it indispensable for front-end development. With the rise of server-side JavaScript through Node.js, it has become an essential tool 	for full-stack developers as well.
